# Stock Analysis Project

This project is a collaborative effort between Alexander Straub and William Sharp. We employed Yahoo Finance's API to obtain live data and used NumPy to compute leading market indicators. We trained ensemble classifiers from Scikit-Learn to assess confidence in our predicted movement for a given stock. In a simulation, our trading strategy outperformed the S&P 500 by 5%. The application also creates charts using Matplotlib and is integrated into a Discord Bot deployed on a cloud server.

## Usage Examples

Usage examples can be found in the `FinalTutScript.py` file.
